# reqpretty Examples

This directory contains examples to demonstrate how to use the `reqpretty` middleware.

## Available Examples

1.  **`basic_example.go`**: A minimal "quick start" example showing how to apply the middleware with default options.
2.  **`advanced_example.go`**: A comprehensive example that showcases all available features, including query parameters, headers, context attributes, and custom emojis.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

You can run either example directly from your terminal. Make sure you are in the root directory of the project.

```bash
go run ./examples/basic_example.go
```
