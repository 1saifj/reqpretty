# reqpretty Examples

This directory contains examples to demonstrate how to use the `reqpretty` middleware.

## Available Examples

1.  **`basic`**: A minimal "quick start" example showing how to apply the middleware with default options.
2.  **`advanced`**: A comprehensive example that showcases all available features, including query parameters, headers, context attributes, and custom emojis.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
